             They are among the simpler interactive software tools, and, as such, they provide operations for the user to select one at a time. 
            They can be used to perform any process that consists of a sequence of steps each of which applies one of these operations, <br>and have no purpose other than these processes, because the operations are the sole,  <br>
            or at least the primary, features of the calculator, rather than being secondary features that support other functionality that is not normally known simply as calculation.
             As a calculator, rather than a computer, they usually have a small set of relatively simple operations, perform short processes that are not compute intensive and do not accept large amounts of input data or produce many results.
